Goal #1: Improve my knowledge in computer science: understand new concepts presented during class, be able to program in new unfamiliar frameworks, be able to understand

Goal #2: Develop for the school: assist with the publishing of at least one school-centric project, identify problems that could be solved, meet the needs of the GA community
